# Mission Scan Feature Specification

## Overview

The Mission Scan feature represents a major evolution of the Mission Control system, transforming it from a continuous quest log interface to a strategic mission selection interface. This change shifts the focus from reactive quest tracking to proactive mission planning and selection.

## Current vs. New Architecture

### Current Implementation
- **Quest Log Display**: Shows completed quest history in chronological order
- **Single Action**: "Deploy on mission" button that immediately starts a randomized quest
- **No Mission Selection**: Players have no choice in mission type or objectives
- **Immediate Execution**: Quests start instantly without preview or preparation

### New Mission Scan Architecture
- **Mission Control Overview**: Card-based grid for scanning and viewing available missions
- **Mission Details View**: Separate route showing detailed mission information
- **Mission Outlines**: Simplified mission templates with basic information
- **Strategic Planning**: Players scan, review, and navigate to missions before deployment
- **Deployment Preparation**: Deploy action available in mission details view (future feature)

## Feature Requirements

### 1. Mission Control Overview Interface

**Replace the current quest log with a mission overview interface:**
- **Layout**: Responsive card grid (2-3 columns on desktop, 1-2 on mobile)
- **Initial State**: Empty grid with explanatory message and prominent scan button
- **Card Design**: Clean, modern cards showing mission outlines
- **Navigation**: Click mission card navigates to mission details route
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation support

### 2. Mission Details View

**Separate route showing detailed mission information:**
- **Route**: `/mission-control/missions/:missionId`
- **Layout**: StandardView with mission details as main content
- **Mission Brief**: Expanded description and objectives (simplified dummy content)
- **Mission Parameters**: Travel time, difficulty rating, basic information
- **Deployment Action**: "Deploy Clone" button (functionality for future development)
- **Navigation**: Back to Mission Control Overview via breadcrumbs

### 3. Mission Scan Functionality

**Scan button creates new mission outlines:**
- **Button Location**: Prominent position in mission control overview interface
- **Button Text**: "Deep Space Scan" or "Scan for Missions"
- **Action**: Generates and adds a new mission outline to the grid
- **Feedback**: Loading state during scan process (500-1000ms)
- **Limit**: Maximum number of active missions (5-10 missions)

### 4. Mission Card Content

**Each mission card displays summary information:**

#### Visual Elements
- **Mission Image**: Use `assets/mission/placeholder.png` initially
- **Mission Type Icon**: Visual indicator of mission category
- **Status Badge**: Available, In Progress (future), Completed (future)
- **Navigation Indicator**: Visual cue that card is clickable/navigates

#### Mission Summary
- **Title**: Simple procedurally generated mission name
  - Examples: "Deep Space Patrol", "Asteroid Survey", "Station Check"
- **Travel Time**: Simple time display (e.g., "2 hours", "1 day")
- **Brief Description**: 1 sentence mission summary (static dummy content)
- **Difficulty Indicator**: Simple visual difficulty rating (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- **Resource Indicator**: Simple icon showing mission involves resources

#### Mission Outline Data Structure
```typescript
interface MissionOutline {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  briefDescription: string;
  detailedDescription: string;
  imageUrl: string;
  travelTime: string;
  difficulty: 'Easy' | 'Medium' | 'Hard';
  missionType: 'exploration' | 'mining' | 'patrol';
  status: 'available' | 'in-progress' | 'completed';
  discoveredAt: Date;
  hasResources: boolean; // Simple flag for resource missions
}
```

### 5. Navigation & Routing

**Multi-view navigation flow:**
- **Mission Control Overview**: `/mission-control` - Main grid showing all available missions
- **Mission Details**: `/mission-control/missions/:missionId` - Detailed mission view
- **Navigation Actions**: Click mission card navigates to details route
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: "Station Overview > Mission Control > [Mission Name]"
- **Action Separation**: Scan button in overview, Deploy button in details

## Technical Implementation Plan

   - `MissionStore` using NgRx signals
   - Available mission tracking (no selection state needed)
   - No integration with quest system (kept separate)

3. **Mission Service**
   - `mission-control/services/mission.service.ts`
   - `MissionService` for mission outline generation
   - Simple procedural mission creation with dummy content
   - Mission state management and persistence

### Phase 2: UI Components & Routing
1. **Mission Control Overview Component**
   - `mission-control/components/mission-control-overview.component.ts`

3. **Resource Preview Granularity**: Should missions show specific resource types only, or also hint at quantity ranges?

4. **Concurrent Mission Limits**: How many missions should players be able to scan and keep available?

5. **Mission Refresh**: Should players be able to clear/refresh available missions, or only add new ones?

6. **Selection Persistence**: Should selected mission state persist across browser sessions?

### Technical Concerns

1. **Mission Outline Storage**: How to structure mission outline data for optimal performance and extensibility?

2. **State Management**: Keeping mission control state separate from quest system while maintaining clean architecture?

3. **Component Architecture**: Best practices for StandardView sidebar integration with mission details?

4. **Testing Strategy**: How to test mission generation and selection flows without quest system integration?

5. **Performance**: Impact of storing multiple mission outlines and rendering card grids?

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- **Mission Scan Frequency**: How often players scan for new missions
- **Mission Selection Patterns**: Which mission types are most popular
- **Completion Rates**: Success rates compared to current quest system

### System Performance

- **Performance Regression**: Mission grid or state management causing UI lag

### Medium Risk
- **Design Inconsistency**: New mission cards not matching game aesthetic
- **User Experience Confusion**: Players not understanding mission outline vs. execution phases
- **State Management Complexity**: Mission selection and persistence edge cases

### Low Risk
- **Visual Polish**: Minor aesthetic issues with card design or grid layout
- **Mission Generation**: Edge cases in procedural mission outline creation
- **Accessibility**: Minor keyboard navigation or screen reader issues

## Conclusion

The Mission Scan feature creates a strategic planning layer for mission control without disrupting existing quest functionality. By keeping mission outlines separate from quest execution, players gain mission selection and preview capabilities while maintaining the proven quest mechanics.

The mission-control feature becomes a self-contained mission planning interface with clear separation of concerns. The StandardView integration provides intuitive navigation between mission scanning overview and detailed mission information.

The phased implementation focuses first on core infrastructure (models, store, service) then builds UI components, ensuring solid foundations before user-facing features. The mission outline approach provides flexibility for future deployment and execution systems.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and approve this updated specification
2. Answer stakeholder questions about mission persistence and limits
3. Create UI mockups for mission cards and details sidebar
4. Define mission generation templates and variety
5. Begin Phase 1 implementation with mission-control infrastructure
