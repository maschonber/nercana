# Nercana Quest - Game Setting

## Game Overview

Nercana Quest is a strategic space management game with roleplaying elements and automatic exploration mechanics. The player controls a stranded AI on a dilapidated space station, cloning humans to send on missions that gather resources, repair the station, and explore the star system through a mission-based progression system.

## Core Features

### Human Clones

Players create and manage human clones with unique traits and abilities. These expendable-yet-endearing characters gain experience and resources through missions but can die, adding strategic risk. Despite their intended disposability, clones develop quirky personalities and humorous interactions that foster player attachment.

### Mission System

Randomly generated missions form the game's core, offering exploration, combat, and resource gathering challenges. Each mission consists of multiple short steps with automated combat determined by clone stats and abilities. Success yields resources, experience, and upgrade opportunities, while higher-level missions provide better rewards at greater risk.

### Tone & Narrative

The game balances engaging storytelling with lighthearted gameplay, maintaining humor around clone expendability while providing meaningful choices. The AI and its advisor deliver guidance with dry wit, enhancing the experience without overwhelming the strategic elements.

### Resource Management

Five primary resources drive progression:

- **Goo** - Organic material for cloning, upgrades, and replacement limbs (from enemies/environment)
- **Metal** - Salvaged materials for repairs and equipment crafting (from asteroids/derelicts)
- **Tech Parts** - Advanced components for system upgrades (from abandoned ships/stations)
- **Energy** - Powers station systems (generated through upgrades, not collected)
- **Cloning Templates** - Rare items enabling unique clone creation (from vendors/existing clones)

### Station Upgrades

Resource-driven upgrades enhance clone production, crafting, and processing capabilities. Upgrading facilities like scanners and harbors unlocks new mission types and improves operational efficiency.

### Visual Design

Clean, modern UI featuring a dark color scheme with futuristic accents. Grid-based layout with subtle shadows and rounded corners ensures intuitive navigation across responsive layouts. Dark grays and blues dominate the palette, with bright accents highlighting important elements.

### Enemies

Diverse threats range from primitive creatures to intelligent space-faring entities:

- **Space Slugs** - Varied mollusks inhabiting asteroid fields
- **Xriit** - Cunning, technologically advanced strategists
- **Moggos** - Aggressive, thick-furred brutes relying on strength and numbers
- **Critters** - Numerous vermin infesting abandoned station maintenance areas
- **Space Mercs** - Zealous humanoid raiders pursuing loot and glory

### Objectives

Repair and upgrade the space station while exploring the star system through effective resource management and strategic clone deployment. As clones develop personalities and strength, players may form emotional attachments that add depth to the strategic gameplay.
