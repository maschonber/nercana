# Nercana Quest - Game Setting

## Game Overview
Nercana Quest is a strategic space management game with roleplaying elements and an automatic exploration and battle system. The player controls a stranded AI on a dilapidated space station, cloning life forms to send on quests to gather resources, repair the station and further its goals. The game features a mission-based progression system, where players manage resources, upgrade their station, and explore the star system.

## Core Features

### Human Clones
Players can create and manage human clones, each with unique traits and abilities. These clones can be sent on missions, where they gain experience to improve their skills and resources to enhance the station. While clones get better with experience, they can also die in missions, adding a layer of risk and strategy to the game. While introduced as expendable goons, the clones are designed to be endearing, with quirky personalities and humorous interactions that make players care about their fates.

### Mission System
The mission system is at the heart of Nercana Quest. Players can send their clones on various missions, each with different objectives and challenges. Successful missions yield valuable resources, experience points, and opportunities for station upgrades. However, missions also come with risks, and players must carefully consider their clone's abilities and the mission's difficulty before embarking on a quest.

Missions are randomly generated when scanning the star system, providing a diverse range of challenges and rewards. They consist of multiple steps, each taking a short time to complete, creating a sense of progression and adventure. Encounters with enemies are handled through an automated combat system, where the outcome is determined by the clones' stats and abilities to ensure a fast-paced and engaging experience.

Players can choose from different mission types, such as exploration, combat, or resource gathering, each with its own unique challenges and rewards. Higher-level missions yield better rewards but also pose greater risks, requiring players to balance their clone's abilities and the mission's difficulty.

### Tone
The tone of the game strikes a balance between engaging storytelling and lighthearted gameplay, allowing players to immerse themselves in the world without feeling overwhelmed by the stakes. Especially when dealing with the clones and their presumed expendability, the game maintains a sense of humor while still providing meaningful choices and consequences. The AI and its advisor provide a mix of guidance and dry wit, enhancing the overall experience without detracting from the strategic elements of resource management and mission planning.

### Resource Management
Players must use their clones to gather resources while on missions. These resources are essential for repairing and upgrading the space station, allowing players to progress through the game. There are several main types of resources, including:

- **Goo** - Organic material used for cloning and upgrades, and replacement limbs. It is collected from defeated enemies and found in the environment.
- **Metal** - Salvaged materials from the station and space debris, used for repairs and crafting equipment. Can be mined from asteroids or collected from derelict ships.
- **Tech Parts** - Advanced components used for upgrading the station's systems and crafting new equipment. These are often found in abandoned ships or space stations.
- **Energy** - Used to power the station and its systems. It is not collected, but rather generated through upgrades and resource management.
- **Cloning Templates** - Special items that allow players to create new clones with unique abilities and genetic traits. These are rare and can be purchased from vendors or created from clones.

### Station Upgrades
Players can upgrade their space station using the resources gathered from missions. Upgrades improve the station's capabilities, allowing for better clone production, crafting, and resource processing. By upgrading the scanner, ship harbor, and other facilities, players can unlock new mission types, increase mission speed and enhance the overall efficiency of their operations.

### Visual Style
The game features a clean, modern UI design with a sleek, dark color scheme and futuristic accents. The interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with clear icons and buttons for easy navigation. The game uses a grid-based layout with subtle shadows and rounded corners, creating a visually appealing experience. The color palette consists of dark grays and blues, with bright accents for important elements. 

The game also features a responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices. There is a main view that displays the player's station, clones, and mission log, with a sidebar for quick access to important information.

### Enemies
Enemies in Nercana Quest are diverse and challenging, ranging from primitive alien creatures to sentient space-faring entities. There are several main species and groups of enemies, each with unique abilities and weaknesses. Examples include:
- **Space Slugs** - Space-faring mollusks that exist in different sizes and shapes, often found in asteroid fields.
- **Xriit** - A highly intelligent species with advanced technology, known for their cunning and strategic prowess.
- **Moggos** - An aggressive, thick-furred species that relies on brute strength and numbers to overwhelm their opponents.
- **Critters** - Vermin-like creatures that are small and numerous, often found in the maintenance areas of abandoned space stations.
- **Space Mercs** - A group of humanoid raiders who prey on unsuspecting travelers, zealous in their pursuit of loot and glory.

### Goals
The primary goal of Nercana Quest is to repair and upgrade the space station while exploring the star system and completing missions. Players must manage their resources effectively, upgrade their station, and send clones on missions to gather materials and experience. As clones grow in strength and personality, players might find themselves attached to their creations, adding an emotional layer to the strategic gameplay.
